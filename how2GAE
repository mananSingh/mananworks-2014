Google App Engine

Installing on Linux

To install on Linux:

    Unzip the App Engine SDK file you downloaded (google_appengine_1.9.5.zip), for example:

    	unzip google_appengine_1.9.5.zip 

    Make sure Python 2.7 is installed on your machine using the following command:

      	/usr/bin/env python -V

    The output should look like this: Python 2.7.<number>. If Python 2.7 isn't installed, install it now using the installation instructions for your Linux distribution.
